🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM) — Summary

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression, but it is mainly used for classification problems.

The goal of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.

Hyperplane: A decision boundary that separates classes

Margin: Distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points

Support vectors: The data points closest to the hyperplane that define the margin

SVM works by maximizing this margin, which helps improve generalization and reduces overfitting.

If the data is linearly separable, SVM finds a straight-line (or plane) hyperplane.

If the data is non-linearly separable, SVM uses kernel functions to project data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable.

Common kernels:

Linear

Polynomial

RBF (Gaussian)

Sigmoid

SVM uses a hinge loss function and a regularization parameter C, which controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors.

SVM performs well on high-dimensional data, is effective for small to medium datasets, but is computationally expensive for very large datasets.
