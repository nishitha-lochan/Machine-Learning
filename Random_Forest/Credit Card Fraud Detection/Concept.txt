## What is Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees using bagging and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Core Idea

->Many uncorrelated decision trees together form a strong and stable model.

## How Random Forest Works

->Randomly samples data with replacement (bootstrap sampling)

->Trains a decision tree on each sample

->Uses a random subset of features at each split

->Repeats the process for multiple trees

->Combines predictions using majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression)

## Why Random Forest

->Reduces overfitting

->Handles non-linear relationships

->Works well with large datasets

->Robust to noise and outliers

->Provides feature importance

# Limitations

->Slower to train than a single decision tree

->Less interpretable

->High memory usage for many trees

## Important Parameters
->n_estimators

Number of trees in the forest
More trees usually improve performance but increase training time.

->max_depth

Maximum depth of each tree
Controls overfitting.

->max_features

Number of features considered at each split
Adds randomness and reduces correlation between trees.

->min_samples_split

Minimum number of samples required to split a node.

->min_samples_leaf

Minimum number of samples required at a leaf node.

->class_weight

Used to handle imbalanced datasets.
Example: balanced

->n_jobs

Number of CPU cores used during training.
-1 means use all cores.

->random_state

Controls randomness and ensures reproducible results.

->Feature Importance

Random Forest provides feature importance scores that indicate how much each feature contributes to the model’s predictions.

->Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy (not reliable for imbalanced data)
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
Confusion Matrix

## Random Forest vs Decision Tree

Decision Tree easily overfits and is unstable.
Random Forest reduces variance and provides better generalization.

## Bagging vs Boosting

Random Forest uses bagging where trees are trained independently.
Boosting methods train models sequentially and focus on misclassified samples.

# When to Use Random Forest

Tabular datasets

Non-linear relationships

Medium to large datasets

Strong baseline model requirement
