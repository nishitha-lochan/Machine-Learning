#  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) :

## Overview:
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** is a **supervised, non-parametric, distance-based** algorithm used for **classification and regression**.

- No explicit training phase
- Predictions are based on nearest data points

---

## How KNN Works:
1. Choose value of **K**
2. Calculate distance between test point and all training points
3. Select **K nearest neighbors**
4. Predict:
   - Classification → Majority vote
   - Regression → Mean of neighbors

---

##  Distance Metrics:
- Euclidean (default)
- Manhattan
- Minkowski
- Cosine (high-dimensional data)

---

## Important Hyperparameters
| Parameter | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `n_neighbors`| Number of neighbors (K) |
| `weights` | `uniform` or `distance` |
| `metric` | Distance metric |
| `p` | Minkowski distance power |

---

##  Feature Scaling (MANDATORY)
KNN is **distance-based**, so features must be scaled.

Recommended:
- `StandardScaler`
- `MinMaxScaler`

 Without scaling → incorrect neighbors

---

##  Overfitting & Underfitting
- **Small K** → Overfitting (noise sensitive)
- **Large K** → Underfitting (over-smoothed)

Rule of thumb:
K ≈ √n


---

##  Bias–Variance Tradeoff
- Small K → Low bias, high variance
- Large K → High bias, low variance

---

##  Advantages
- Simple and intuitive
- No training time
- Handles non-linear patterns well

---

##  Disadvantages
- Slow prediction
- High memory usage
- Sensitive to noise & outliers
- Poor performance in high dimensions

---

##  When to Use KNN
- Small datasets
- Distance-based problems
- Baseline model
- Recommendation systems (basic)

---

##  KNN vs Decision Tree
| KNN | Decision Tree |
|----|--------------|
| Lazy learner | Eager learner |
| Distance-based | Rule-based |
| Needs scaling | No scaling |
| Slow prediction | Fast prediction |

## Interview Notes
- “KNN is a lazy, instance-based learner.”
- “Feature scaling is essential.”
- “Small K causes overfitting.”
- “KNN suffers from curse of dimensionality.”

##  Use Cases
- Recommendation systems
- Pattern recognition
- Image classification (small datasets)
- Anomaly detection
