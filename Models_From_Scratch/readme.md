# ML Models From Scratch (Python)

This repository is a **long-term collection of Machine Learning algorithms implemented completely from scratch** using Python. The goal is to deeply understand how machine learning works internally by building algorithms step by step, without relying on high-level ML libraries.

The focus of this repository is on **fundamentals, clarity, and learning**, rather than quick results using pre-built functions.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Modern ML libraries hide most of the internal logic of algorithms. This repository exists to:

* Build a strong foundation in machine learning  
* Understand the mathematics and logic behind algorithms  
* Learn how models learn patterns from data   
* Implement optimization techniques manually  
* Prepare for AI/ML internships, interviews, and academic projects

Each algorithm added here is written with simplicity and clear explanations in mind.
