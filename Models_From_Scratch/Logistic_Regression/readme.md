📘 Logistic Regression — From Scratch
Overview

This folder contains an implementation of Logistic Regression built from scratch using Python. The focus is on understanding how logistic regression performs binary classification by combining linear models with probabilistic interpretation.

🎯 Objective

-Understand binary classification from a mathematical perspective  

-Learn how probabilities are modeled using sigmoid activation  

-Implement classification logic without ML libraries  

🧠 Concepts Covered

-Linear combination of inputs  

-Sigmoid activation function  

-Binary Cross-Entropy loss  

-Gradient computation  

-Gradient Descent optimization  

-Decision thresholding  

⚙️ Approach

The model computes a linear score and transforms it into a probability using the sigmoid function. The loss function penalizes incorrect predictions, and parameters are updated iteratively using gradient descent to improve classification performance.
