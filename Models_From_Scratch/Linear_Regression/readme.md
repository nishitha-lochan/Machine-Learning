📘 Linear Regression — From Scratch
Overview

This folder contains an implementation of Linear Regression built completely from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand how linear regression works internally by manually implementing the mathematical formulation and optimization process instead of using pre-built machine learning libraries.

🎯 Objective

-Understand how linear models learn relationships between variables  

-Implement the learning process step by step  

-Learn how gradient descent minimizes error   

🧠 Concepts Covered

-Linear hypothesis function  

-Weight and bias initialization   

-Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function  

-Gradient computation  

-Gradient Descent optimization  

-Model convergence

⚙️ Approach

The model predicts continuous values using a linear equation. During training, the error between predicted and actual values is calculated, and parameters are updated iteratively using gradient descent to minimize the loss.

📈 Learning Outcome

After studying this implementation, you will be able to:

-Explain how linear regression works mathematically 

-Implement gradient descent manually 

-Understand the role of loss functions 

-Debug training issues like slow convergence  

📌 Use Case

Linear Regression is commonly used for:  

-Predicting numerical values  

-Understanding relationships between variables   

-Baseline models in machine learning pipelines
