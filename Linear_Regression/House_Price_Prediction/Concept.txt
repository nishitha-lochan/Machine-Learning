Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values.
It assumes a linear relationship between independent features and the target variable.

The model is defined as:
y = w·x + b,
where w represents feature weights and b is the bias (intercept).

Initially, weights and bias are initialized, and predictions are made.
The error between predicted and actual values is calculated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

To minimize this loss, Gradient Descent is used, where weights and bias are updated iteratively using the learning rate until the loss is minimized.

Linear regression is simple and interpretable but does not perform well for non-linear relationships and is sensitive to outliers.
